# Raspberry Pi CM4 Seaberry

A simple case for the Alftel Seaberry CM4 carrier board.

The antenna ports in the back are too close together - this should be fine for receive-only sniffer purposes, but probably less so for transmitting.

The "window" version of the case top is for the Pimoroni LED Dot Matrix pi-hat, which is no longer available for sale.  The "closed" version is the same, but without the window.

Additional cooling may be required via a 40x40 fan, which should press-fit into the lid and can be connected to the fan port on the seaberry.
