# BladeRF Micro + Amps

The bladeRF Micro has an excellent case - but the B200/B100 amplifiers don't fit inside of it, and are itching to get broken off.

This is a basic case which holds the bladeRF Micro and the amps, and shields them.  It has equivalent headroom to the official case, plus some ventilation.

It's designed to be printed on any FDM printer, and fastened with 4 pointed M2 or similarly sized screws.
