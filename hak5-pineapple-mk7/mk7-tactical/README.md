    The exact length is not vital.

    Any insert with an approximately 7mm outer diameter will work.

5. (Optional) [3 Short antennas](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B076SGTMFS/)

## Printing

For strength the case should likely be printed from PETG, however other materials are likely fine in most situations.

Also for strength, the number of perimeters should be boosted; 5 to 8 perimeters will yield a good result.
