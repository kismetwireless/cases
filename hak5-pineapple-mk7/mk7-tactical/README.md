## Tactical Kismet case

Have an acrylic Kismet MK7 case?  Want to get in on the tacti-cool mounting?  Grab the [./mk7-kismetcase-tactical-bottom.stl](Kismet mod bottom STL); it replaces the existing blank acrylic bottom piece and uses the same screws.

## Parts list

In addition to printing the [./mk7-tactical-case-top.stl](top) and [./mk7-tactical-case-bottom.stl](bottom) parts of the case, you will need:

1. 4x [M5 10-16mm bolts](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07KWQ4JFK/)

    The exact length is not vital.

2. 4x [M5 heat-set inserts](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B08T9VRVYV/)

    Any insert with an approximately 7mm outer diameter will work.

3. 4x [M3 5mm screws](https://smile.amazon.com/iExcell-Stainless-Socket-Screws-Wrench/dp/B089KSWKQT/)

4. (Optional) [1 inch webbing](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B08ZSXHY73)

5. (Optional) [3 Short antennas](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B076SGTMFS/)

## Printing

Generally for strength and durability I recommend printing the case in PETG, however PLA is likely just fine for most situations.

For strength, the prints should be done with extra perimeters; 4 to 8 perimeters in the slicer should yield a very strong print.
